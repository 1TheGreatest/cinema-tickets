# Cinema Tickets â€“ NodeJS Assessment

## âœ… Tests

The test suite (`tests/TicketService.test.js`) covers:

- Valid purchases (single adult, mixed tickets, edge cases).
- Invalid purchases (invalid accountId, >25 tickets, infants > adults, children/infants without adult).
- Order of operations (payment before seat reservation).
- Ensures external services are not called on invalid requests.
